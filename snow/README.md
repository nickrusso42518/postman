# ServiceNOW REST API
Postman collection to manage ServiceNOW.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection,
  * `template`: Contains host/credential information which users can
    populate. The `oauth2_client_id` and `oauth2_client_secret` are used to
    obtain a token, which is optional. Basic authentication can be used
    as a simpler alternative. `instance` is the domain prefix unique to
    your environment.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit. Note that
you can obtain a free developer instance for testing by ServiceNOW as well.
