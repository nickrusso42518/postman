# Cisco Extended Detection and Response (XDR) for SAUTO
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco XDR REST API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `xdr_learnlab`: Contains a pre-made environment to access the read-only
    environment used in the DevNet learning labs. The credentials may
    change over time, so check DevNet's website for updates.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
