# Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC)
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco NDFC REST API, formerly
known as Cisco DCNM.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `dcloud`: Contains host/credential information for the Cisco dCloud
    reservable NDFC (VXLAN/EVPN) demo, which requires a dCloud account
    and valid reservation to utilize.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
