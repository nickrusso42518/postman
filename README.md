# Postman collections
Free Postman collections for all to enjoy! Each directory corresponds
to a collection for a specific product/technology. Please read the
copyright at the bottom of each collection's README before use.

You can clone this repository, but I recommend visiting my personal
[website](http://njrusmc.net/jobaid/jobaid.html)
to download a self-contained `zip` archive for portability.

You can also view these collections, plus some un-exportable ones
(websocket/gRPC), using my online Postman public
[workspace](https://www.postman.com/njrusmc/workspace/public-collections/overview).
