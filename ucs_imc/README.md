# Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) IMC
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco UCS IMC API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection, which is a template
for the variables used in the requests. There is no DevNet sandbox for UCS.
You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
